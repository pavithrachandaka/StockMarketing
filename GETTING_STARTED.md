```

**2. Qiskit Installation Issues**
```bash
# Install Qiskit separately
pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning qiskit-aer
```

**3. Data Fetching Issues**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Yahoo Finance is accessible
- Try using a VPN if needed

**4. Memory Issues**
- Reduce the number of features

- Use fewer training iterations

### Error Messages

**"No module named 'qiskit'"**
```bash
pip install qiskit
```

**"Failed to collect data"**
- Check internet connection
- Try running again later
- Verify Yahoo Finance API access

**"Training failed"**
- Reduce training iterations
- Check available memory
- Try with fewer features

## üìà Expected Performance

### Model Accuracy
- **Random Forest**: 55-65%
- **SVM**: 50-60%
- **VQC**: 45-55%
- **Hybrid**: 55-65%
